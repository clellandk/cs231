4. The whois command returned contact info for the registrant, administrative contact, technical contact, and the educause database, which registers .edu domains. nslookup also returned info for abuse handling, tech handling, and the range of IP addresses.

Part 2 
Local Network:
1. The Ip addresses (for active hosts) are 10.0.2.1, 10.0.2.2, and 10.0.2.15. 
2. The addresses 10.0.2.1 and 10.0.2.2 are other devices connected to the same network as our virtual Kali machine. They could be the network gateway or a server of some sort. The other address (10.0.2.15) is our own machine.
3. For every possible IP address it send out a who has (IP address) broadcast, and says to tell (Our IP address). If it gets a response from the IP adress it concludes the server is up. 

Carleton's 137.22.4.0 network: 
1.137.22.4.5, 137.22.4.17, 137.22.4.19, 137.22.4.20, 137.22.4.22
, 137.22.4.31, 137.22.4.32, 137.22.4.34
, 137.22.4.35, 137.22.4.37, 137.22.4.42, 137.22.4.46, 137.22.4.48, 137.22.4.49, 137.22.4.60, 137.22.4.61, 137.22.4.66, 137.22.4.75, 137.22.4.77, 137.22.4.87, 137.22.4.91, 137.22.4.96, 137.22.4.98, 137.22.4.101, 137.22.4.102, 137.22.4.106, 137.22.4.110, 137.22.4.113, 137.22.4.114, 137.22.4.147, 137.22.4.155, 137.22.4.175, 137.22.4.182, 137.22.4.188
2. These represent various devices connected to Carleton's Math/CS server. Most of them appear to be lab computers, although we also noticed two professors who were online as well as connections in the Weitz and the Perlman museum.
3. This time our machine attempted the threeway TCP handshake with each IP address on the desired network. The ones that were active responded with a TCP [RST, ACK] packet. The server then sends DNS querry back to the servers that responded (except we noticed that they seem to all be going through two servers that we're guessing are routers for the department), and finally they send back DNS responses.
