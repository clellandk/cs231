Part 1
Passwords cracked: 1162
Total time: 34.90s
Number of hashes computed: 267751 
Passwords cracked per number of hashes computed: 1162/267751 = 0.00433985307
Time per password cracked: 34.90/1162 = 0.0300344234

Part 2
Passwords cracked: 48 (Out of 100, I didn't have time to run the full file)
Total time: 43.02s
Number of hashes computed: 26775100 
Passwords cracked per number of hashes computed: 48/26775100 = 0.00000179271
Time per password cracked: 43.02/48 = 0.89625


The process took about 29.84 times longer. What changes with salted passwords is that you can't just hash all the potential passwords and go compare hashes, because each password you want to crack has a different salt. You have to hash all of the potential passwords (with the salt) everytime you want to crack a single password, which takes the complexity and multiplies it times the number of passwords you're trying to crack.
