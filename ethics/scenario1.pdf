A) The main ethical question here is weighing the privacy of millions of users against the insistance of the company that your actions constitute attempted thievery of trade secrets, and possibly also violate their rights under the DMCA (depending on whether the bug involves encryption and/or copy-protection). In my opinion, this constitutes far too great a risk to not bring up to the company, though admittedly I am assuming a lot of risk in this scenario. Probably what I would do is attempt to send this tip anonymously to the IT team at InstaToonz, Inc. and hope that the issue will be solved without legal proceedings being filed. 

B) I, as well as all of the consumers, should have a right to privacy in all of our private messages if the company promises us that their platform keeps our information private. However, it also seems at least somewhat likely that there might be a clause in a terms and service agreement somewhere (that probably no one read) that either waves this right or shields them from liability so long as they are not found to be at fault for the release of our private information.  

On the company's end they I would argue have significantly more right, particularly if the DMCA is relevant.
